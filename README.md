# Spock in Ten Slides

This is an experiment to produce short, useful documentation for the Spock Framework.

This project is inspired by [Rust in ten slides](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rust-in-ten-slides).

## How it works

1. Copy `template.html` into a new file, name it after the topic of your
   presentation; for example, `extensions.html`.
2. Slides are written in Markdown inside the file using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1),
   check that link for examples of the syntax.
3. Open the file in your web browser to see the presentation in action!
4. Modify `index.html` to include your new presentation.
5. Send me a pull request!
